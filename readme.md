## Mek:Re

Mek:Re is meant as a rewrite of [Mekanism](https://github.com/aidancbrady/Mekanism/).
I will be focusing on the machines and items, leaving energy transport to other mods for now (using [ Darkhax's Tesla API](https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Tesla) as interface, Forge Energy support might be added at a later point in time).
The motivation behind this rewrite is to address issues caused by the messy state the original mod is currently in, caused by it's impressive growth over the years.
This rewrite should hopefully allow for some of the older bugs to be resolved in an easier way.

## Legal
This work is a complete rewrite, and therefore I am not re-using the original code, though I will be re-using many machines textures.
All of the original work is released under MIT license as stated on the github repo (at the time this is written).
Mek:Re is released under GNU GPLv3, a copy of which can be found [here](/LICENSE).
